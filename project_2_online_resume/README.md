## Project 2 Online Resume 
##### Purpose 

Project 2 Online Resume repo was made to develop my JavaScript code capabilities, more specifically in Object Oriented Programming. 

##### How It All Works 

This online resume works primarily using Object Oriented Programming to display resume data found in js/resumeBuilder.js. All personal information displayed in the resume is saved in multiple variables(line 1 -105 resumeBuilder.js). Encapsulated functions append info to the DOM(lines 107 â€“ 213 resumeBuilder.js). 

The js/jQuery.js file contains web functionality and js/helper.js contains background code for rendering and layout effects. 

##### Installation Instructions 

Download repo and run index.html to view online resume.

##### License 

This is an open repo for the general public. Feel free to use!
